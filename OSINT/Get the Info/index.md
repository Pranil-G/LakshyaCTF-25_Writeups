# Get the Info

This challenge revolved around tracking down the email of a ceramic artist based on a series of subtle clues. The description mentioned a visit to Washington, D.C., where the participant had lunch at a popular Indian-Nepali restaurant, followed by a visit to a nearby art gallery within a 0.3-mile radius. The key clue was that the artist specialized in ceramics and had an exhibition at the gallery starting on March 26.

To begin, I searched for well-known Indian and Nepali restaurants in Washington, D.C., and quickly identified Himalayan Doko as a likely candidate, based on its reputation and menu. Next, using Google Maps, I looked for art galleries within walking distance of the restaurant and found Touchstone Gallery, which fit both the distance and prominence criteria.

Visiting the Touchstone Gallery website, I checked their exhibition schedule and confirmed that a ceramic exhibition was indeed opening on March 26. The artist featured for that event was Elena Tchernomazova, a ceramic sculptor, which matched the information in the challenge.

To find her email address, I conducted further research through the galleryâ€™s artist page, social media, and general Google searches. After guessing a bit `elenatchernomazova@gmail.com` turned out to be the correct email.
